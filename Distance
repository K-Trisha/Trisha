Write a program to find the distance between 2 points using functions.

Input Format:

Input consists of 4 integers. The first and second integer corresponds to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the first point. The third and fourth integer corresponds to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the second point.

Output Format:

Output consists of a single floating point number (correct to 2 decimal places.) Refer sample output for formatting details.

Sample Input:

3

6

4

3

Sample Output:

Distance between the 2 points is 3.16

coding:
#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;
float distance(int x1,int y1,int x2,int y2)
{
float a,b,d;
 a=(x2-x1)*(x2-x1);
 b=(y2-y1)*(y2-y1);
 d=sqrt(a+b);
 return d;
}
int main()
{
 int x1,y1,x2,y2;
 cin>>x1>>y1>>x2>>y2;
 printf("Distance between the 2 points is %.2f",distance(x1,y1,x2,y2));
}
